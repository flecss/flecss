### `mx` <span>Class</span>

The class mixin provides extensibility capabilities of an inbuilt flecss class from within a custom class. This way, redundant class statements and inherent markup verbosity can be avoided. The inheritance classifier argument is supposed to be a flecss class name as it would be used within markup.

``` scss
@include flecss_class($classifier)
```

#### Example

``` scss
.card {
    @include flecss_class("padding_v--large");
    
    background-color: lightgray;
}
```
