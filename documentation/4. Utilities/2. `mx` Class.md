### `mx` <span>Class</span>

The class mixin provides extensibility of a flecss class from a custom class. This way, redundant class statements and inherent verbosity can be avoided. The classifier argument is a full class name string as it would be assigned to elements.

``` scss
@include flecss_class($classifier)
```

#### Example

``` scss
.card {
    @include flecss_class("padding_v--large");
    
    background-color: lightgray;
}
```
